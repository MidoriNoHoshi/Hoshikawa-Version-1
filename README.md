# Hoshikawa Version #1 custom background plugin.
---
This plugin allows the user to set a custom background in a Obsidian Workspace (including the file navigator). The images for the custom background need to be hosted on a remote server, and the plugin will not work with local images. 
There are a few additional features that allow the user to add effects to the images (such as bluriness or opacity) to improve legibility.
